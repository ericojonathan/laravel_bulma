#laravel_bulma

This repository is a bare working laravel installation with authentication and bulma css framework. It is based on instructions from vikdiesel's github (https://github.com/vikdiesel/laravel-bulma-auth-preset).

To make this work, as usual do:
1. Edit the .env file and put in the relevant database data.
2. Create your database based on the data you have inputted in .env file.
3. php artisan migrate
